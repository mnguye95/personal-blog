While I was freelancing during the pandemic, I cultivated a checklist for my local SEO services.

Here is that checklist:

## 1. Create a Website

I had some clients who ran their business without a website, and I let them know there's money on the table.

After 12 months into their website, they had to hire a call center to keep up with demand.

A well-designed, fast website is like a digital storefront residing on Google Street.

I won't show you how to do that for now, but I'll save that topic for another post.

If you really want to play around with a website builder, I personally use [Bluehost](https://bluehost.com/) for my clients.

## 2. Create Social Media Accounts

In 2022, there are more than 4 billion people on social media, [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/), 

If you're against using social media, shift how you view these platforms.

Most people have smartphones nowadays, spending most of their time on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and more.

So... is there any value participating in social media? 

__*TRAFFIC.*__

*"Well, I don't have time to manage and create content to drive traffic."*

And that's okay. As long as your social media accounts have your logo, name, address, phone, and website link, we're fine.

Here are some platforms you can set up an account:
```
Facebook
Instagram
LinkedIn
Twitter
Pinterest
YouTube
```
<br>  

Once you've created these accounts, be sure to add them your website's header or footer.

## 3. Set a Google My Business profile

The easiest thing we can do right now is to set up a Google My Business profile, or GMB for short. 

We're telling Google, **"My business exists!"**, and it'll introduce your business to their ***Maps and Search*** results.

And it's free! We all know everyone is using Google for answers, and your local business could be it.

Here's what we'll need to add for your profile:

```
Name
Address
Phone Number
Primary and Secondary categories
Website
Business Hours
Add your products or services
High quality photos
```
<br>  

Once everything is set up, you'll receive a postcard to your business address. It contains a code for verification.

After verifying, your profile should be live. I highly recommend you reach out to your clients and ask for reviews. The more reviews, the higher you are in the search results.

Your clients can write a review directly or through a review link found on your dashboard.

You should also post updates on your profile. Things worth sharing are:

```
What's New? New services, new products, new policies...
Closed for certain days or holidays
Coupons, discounts, sales, freebies, and more.
Hosting an event
Anything you can think of, the more the better!
```
<br>  

## 4. Add Your Business to Local Directories

Also known as local citations, this will further validate your business address as your local location.

It's crucial that we keep our NAP, or **_Name, Address, Phone_**, consistent.

Here are some local directories you can add your business to:

```
yelp.com
maps.apple.com
facebook.com
houzz.com
thumbtack.com
bbb.org
manta.com
bing.com
nextdoor.com
ezlocal.com
...
```
<br>  

Again, the more, the better.

Be sure to add your social media profiles onto your GMB profile as well.

## 5. Building Backlinks

Backlinks are mentions to your website. In the last step, we added our business information including our website link to Yelp's local directory, Yelp is backlinking (mentioning) to your website. Same reasons why we added our website link to our social media accounts.

Backlinks are also graded. Let's say [cnn.com](https://cnn.com) decided to run a story where your local business with your website is mentioned. That is a very strong backlink because CNN is a big, big authority in the news world.

Once Google crawls the CNN article and finds your website link, that'll boost your website up in the search rankings.

In contrast, getting a backlink from some random website won't do much.

Want to see your backlinks? You can check with [Ahrefs' backlink checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker).

## Does Take Time But It Works

These are the exact steps I take for my business. Follow this exact steps and expect more clicks and sales, but don't expect it to happen overnight. Search engine optimization takes time, but it's worth it.
