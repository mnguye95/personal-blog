While I was freelancing during the pandemic, I cultivated a checklist for my local SEO services.

Here is that checklist:

## 1. Create a Website

I have had some clients who run an entire local business without a website. The amount of money left on the table was mind blowing.

Upon launching a website, my clients received too much business that they had to hire a call center and a sales floor to keep up with demand.

A well-designed, fast website is a [Hand of Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) so don't skimp out.

This checklist, however, won't show you how to create an effective website. I'll save that topic for another post.

But if you want to play around with a website builder, I personally use [Bluehost](https://bluehost.com/) for my clients.

## 2. Create Social Media Accounts

In 2022, there are more than 4 billion people on social media, [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/), 

Most people have smartphones nowadays, spending most of their time on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and more.

If you're against using social media, shift how you view these platforms.

Ask yourself. How is there any value participating in social media? 

Of course there is. __*FREE TRAFFIC.*__ Well, free of money, not time.

*"Well, I don't have time to manage and create content to attract people."*

And that's okay. As long as our social media accounts have our logo, name, address, phone, and website link, we're fine.

Here are some platforms you can set up an account:
```
Facebook
Instagram
LinkedIn
Twitter
Pinterest
YouTube
```
<br>  

Once you've created these accounts, be sure to add them your website's header or footer just like how I did for this website.

## 3. Set a Google My Business profile

The easiest thing we can do right now is to set up a profile with Google My Business, or GMB for short. 

We're explicitly telling Google, **"Hey! My business exists!"**, and it'll begin recommending our business to their ***Maps and Search*** platform.

Literally free traffic! We know everyone is using Google to find solutions, and our local business is one of these solutions.

Here's what we'll need to add for our profile:

```
Name
Address
Phone Number
Primary and Secondary categories
Website
Business Hours
Add our products or services
High quality photos
```
<br>  

Once we've set everything up, Google will send a postcard with a verification code to our business address.

After verification, our profile should be live. From here on out, I highly recommend that we reach out to our clients and ask for reviews for our GMB profile. The more reviews, the higher Google will recommend our business in the search results.

You can share a review form found on our dashboard, and our clients can write a review directly.

You should also post updates on our profile. Things worth sharing on our profile are:

```
What's New? New services, new products, new policies...
Closed for certain days or holidays
Coupons, discounts, sales, freebies, and more.
Hosting an event
Anything you can think of, the more the better!
```
<br>  

## 4. Add Business to Local Directories

Also known as local citations, this allows Google to further validate the business address as our local location.

It's crucial that we keep our NAP, or **_Name, Address, Phone_**, consistent.

Here are a few local directories you can add our business to:

```
yelp.com
maps.apple.com
facebook.com
houzz.com
thumbtack.com
bbb.org
manta.com
bing.com
nextdoor.com
ezlocal.com
...
```
<br>  

The more local citations, the better.

Be sure to add your social media profile on your GMB profile as well.

## 5. Build Backlinks

What are backlinks? 

Backlinks are mentions to our website. In the last step, we added our business information including our website link to Yelp's local directory, Yelp is backlinking (mentioning) to our website. Same reasons why we added our website link to our social media accounts.

In the next paragraph, you can see that cnn.com is highlighted orange. I am backlinking CNN in this article.

All backlinks are graded differently. Let's say [cnn.com](https://cnn.com) decided to run a story where our local business with our website is mentioned. That is a very strong backlink because CNN is a big, big authority in the news world.

Google will crawl the CNN article, find our website link, and that'll boost us up in the search rankings.

In contrast, getting a backlink from some random website won't do much.

Have an established website already? You can check your backlinks with [Ahrefs' backlink checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker).

## Takes Times But It Works

These are the very steps I take for all of my clients. Follow this exact steps and expect more clicks and sales.
